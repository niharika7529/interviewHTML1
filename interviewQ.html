1>What is html?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.it is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page.it tells the browser how to display the content
HTML consists of a series of elements.
 example::: 
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html>
 <head>
 <title>Page Title</title>
 </head>
 <body>
 
 <h1>My First Heading</h1>
 <p>My first paragraph.</p>
 
 </body>
 </html>

2>What is use of Doctype ?

The HTML document type declaration, also known as DOCTYPE , is the first line of code required in every HTML or XHTML document.
 The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. 
       EXAMPLE::<!DOCTYPE html>

3>What is elements and attributes?
  
---ELEMENTS---
HTML tags are used to hold the HTML element. HTML element holds the content. HTML attributes are used to describe the characteristic of an HTML element in detail.
 HTML tag starts with < and ends with > Whatever written within a HTML tag are HTML elements.
  <tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
  
  EXAMPLES::
  <h1>My First Heading</h1>
  <p>My first paragraph.</p>


---ATTRIBUTES--
  HTML attributes are used to describe the characteristic of an HTML element in detail.
  Attributes provide extra information or settings for elements

   THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF ATTRIBUTES::
   ----ID ATTRIBUTES---
      used to provide unique id to an element
      The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. 
      Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.
      EXAMPLE::
       <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
#myHeader {
  background-color: lightblue;
  color: black;
  padding: 40px;
  text-align: center;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1 id="myHeader">My Header</h1>

</body>
</html>

 --CLASS ATTRIBUTES---
 The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element.
  class is used to provide or denote group element
  EXAMPLE::
  <html>
<head>
<style>
h1.intro {
    color: blue;
}

p.imp {
    color: green;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1 class="intro">Header 1</h1>
<p>A paragraph.</p>
<p class="imp">Note that this is an important paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

4>Explain tags in html

HTML tags are like keywords which defines that how web browser will format and display the content. 
With the help of tags, a web browser can distinguish between an HTML content and a simple content.
 HTML tags contain three main parts: opening tag, content and closing tag. But some HTML tags are unclosed tags.
 All HTML tags must enclosed within < > these brackets.
 Every tag in HTML perform different tasks.
 If you have used an open tag <tag>, then you must use a close tag </tag> (except some tags)
 Syntax::
 <tag> content </tag>
 EXAMPLES::
 <p> Paragraph Tag </p>
<h2> Heading Tag </h2>
<b> Bold Tag </b>
<i> Italic Tag </i>
<u> Underline Tag</u>

5>Difference between block and inline elements 
---Block-level Elements---
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>
    EXAMPLES::
    <address><article><aside><blockquote><canvas></canvas>

       -- Inline Elements--
An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.
    EXAMPLES::
    <a><abbr><acronym><b><bdo><big><br><button><cite><code><dfn><em></em>

6>Difference between semantics and non semnatics elements
Semantic HTML elements:
These elements simply mean, elements with meaning. 
The reason being, there definition in the code tells the browser and the developer what they are supposed to do. 
Framing in simpler words, these elements describe the type of content they are supposed to contain.
Following is the list of some semantic elements :
article
aside
details
figcaption
figure
footer

---Non-Semantic elements--
Unlike, semantic elements they don’t have any meaning. They don’t tell anything about the content they contain. 
They can be used with different attributes to mark up semantics common to a group.

Following is the list of some non-semantic elements:
div
span

7>Diffference between readonly and disabled 
disabled Attribute: 
The disabled attribute is used to disable the input field so that it cannot be edited or submitted. 
Usually, the color of the input field is greyed out. 
A disabled input field will not be sent with the form data, so it cannot be submitted to the server, & users are also not able to interact with the input field (data). 
It is commonly used when an input field is conditionally disabled or when it’s required to prevent user input.

Syntax:
<input disabled>
EXAMPLE::

<label for="age">Age:</label>
<input id="age" name="age" type="number" value="42" disabled/>

readonly Attribute: 
The readonly attribute is used to disable an input field so that it cannot be edited.
 But the user can still interact with it. Users can see data but it cannot be changed. 
 A readonly input field is usually displayed with a different background color or border, indicating that it cannot be edited. 
The value of a readonly input field can be submitted with the form data.
EXAMPLE::
</div>
<div class="group">
  <input type="date" value="2020-01-01" readonly="readonly" id="date" />
  <label for="date">Date</label>
</div>

8>Use of required attribute 
The required attribute is a boolean attribute. When present, it specifies that an input field must be filled out before submitting the form.
This attribute works with other types of input like radio, checkbox, number, text, etc.
Syntax
<input required>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 
<head>
    <title>
      required Attribute
  </title>
    <style>
        h1,
        h2 {
            color: green;
            font-style: italic;
        }
         
        body {
            text-align: center;
        }
    </style>
</head>
 
<body>

    <h2>
      HTML input required attribute 
  </h2>
    <form>
        Username:
        <input type="text"
               name="username"
               required>
        <br> Password:
        <input type="password"
               name="password">
        <br>
        <input type="submit">
    </form>
</body>
 
</html>


9>Explain anchor tag and its attributes 
The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.
 The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.
    Syntax:
<a href = "link"> Link Name </a> 
ATTRIBUTES---
href--Specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
target--Specifies where to open the linked document

10>How to embed image on webpage 
he HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page. Images are not technically inserted into a web page;
 images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

 The <img> tag has two required attributes:
src - Specifies the path to the image
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>HTML Image</h2>
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600">

</body>
</html>

11>What is list,types of list and how to display list in html
A list is just one of many ways of organizing information, and in HTML, there are three types of lists:
Ordered
Unordered
Description
ORDERED LISTS::
The Ordered lists have an order which is either numerical or alphabetical.
The <ol> tag is used to create ordered lists in HTML and just like unordered list, we use <li> tag to define or show lists inside <ol> tag.

    Syntax:
    
    <ol>
       <li>Item1</li>
       <li>Item2</li>
       <li>Item3</li>
    </ol>
    The ordered list has a type operator which defines what type of order the list will have, like whether the list will start with a numerical value or an alphabetical value. The various ways to use the ordered list, are given below:

    type = “1”: List will start from 1.
    type = “A”: Here the list will start from A.
    type = “a”: Here the list will start from lowercase a.
    type = “I”: The list will start from Roman numbers.
    type = “i”: TheList will start from lowercase Roman numbers.
    EXAMPLE::
    <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 
<head>
    <title>HTML Lists</title>
</head>
 
<body>
   
    <h4>HTML Ordered List</h4>
    <h4>Coding Language</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>C</li>
        <li>C++</li>
        <li>Core-Java</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
    </ol>
</body>
 
</html>
UNORDERED LIST--
An Unordered list is used to create a list of related items, in bulleted or unordered format. 
It starts with the <ul> tag, followed by the <li> tag to show list items inside <ul> tag. 

    Syntax:
    
    <ul>
       <li>Item1</li>
       ...
    </ul>
    We can also use different CSS properties to create a list with different styles. It can have one of the following values :

circle: It gives a circle list item marker.
square: It gives square as list item marker.
disc: This is the default filled circular bullet item marker.
none: This is used to unmark list 
EXAMPLE::
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 
<head>
    <title>HTML Lists</title>
</head>
 
<body>
    
    <h4>HTML Unordered List</h4>
    <h4>Coding Language</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>C</li>
        <li>C++</li>
        <li>Core-Java</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
    </ul>
</body>
 
</html>

12>How to embed audio and video tag?
 AUDIO---
 To embed audio in HTML, we use the <audio> tag.
 Syntax:
 <audio>
     <source src="file_name" type="audio_file_type">
 </audio>
 EXAMPLE::
 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Click play button to play audio</h2>
<audio src="./test.mp3" controls></audio>
</body>
</html>

VIDEO--
To embed video in HTML, we use the <video> tag. 
    It contains one or more video sources at a time using <source> tag. It supports MP4, WebM, and Ogg in all modern browsers. 
    Syntax--
<video>
    <source src="file_name" type="video_file_type">
</video>
 EXAMPLE::
 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Click play button to play video</h2>
<video src="./test.mp4" controls></video>
</body>
</html>

13>What is iframe?
The <iframe> tag specifies an inline frame.
    An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.
    Syntax
    <iframe src="url" title="description"></iframe>
    EXAMPLE::
    <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>HTML Iframes</h2>
<p>You can use the height and width attributes to specify the size of the iframe:</p>

<iframe src="demo_iframe.htm" height="200" width="300" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>

</body>
</html>

14>Semantics tag-- header,fo
HTML <header> Element

        and build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature.</p>
      </article>

     ... HTML <footer> Element
        The <footer> element defines a footer for a document or section.

      authorship information
        copyright information
        contact information
        sitemap
        back to top links
        related documents
